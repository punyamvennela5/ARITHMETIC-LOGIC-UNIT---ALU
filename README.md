# ARITHMETIC-LOGIC-UNIT---ALU
### Introduction to 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (8-bit ALU)

An **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (8-bit ALU)** is a digital circuit designed to perform arithmetic and logic operations on 8-bit binary numbers. It is a core component of 8-bit microprocessors and plays a critical role in executing instructions in many embedded systems and early computing architectures.

#### What is 8-bit?

An **8-bit system** can process data that is 8 bits wide, meaning each operand and result in the ALU consists of **8 binary digits** (bits), allowing representation of values from **0 to 255** (unsigned) or **-128 to +127** (signed).

### Key Functions of an 8-bit ALU:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**:

   * Addition and subtraction of two 8-bit numbers
   * Increment and decrement
   * Sometimes multiplication and division (either directly or through software routines)

2. **Logic Operations**:

   * AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR
   * Bitwise operations on 8-bit inputs

3. **Shift and Rotate Operations**:

   * Left shift, right shift, rotate left, and rotate right

4. **Comparison Operations**:

   * Equal to, greater than, less than, with flags like Zero, Carry, Negative, and Overflow being set as needed

### Components of an 8-bit ALU:

* **Inputs**: Two 8-bit binary operands (A and B)
* **Control Signals**: Determine the operation to be performed
* **Output**: 8-bit result
* **Status Flags**: Indicate specific conditions (e.g., zero result, carry out, overflow)

---

### Applications:

* Used in **8-bit microprocessors** like Intel 8085 or Motorola 6800
* Found in **embedded systems**, calculators, simple controllers, and digital signal processors
* Useful in **teaching and learning** about digital logic and CPU design
